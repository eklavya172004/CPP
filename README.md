# 🧠 Competitive Programming — Daily Grind 🚀

Welcome to my **Daily CP Practice Repo**!  
This repository is my personal commitment to **consistent growth**, **daily discipline**, and becoming a stronger problem solver.

Every day, I solve at least **one CP problem** and upload my solution here.  
Some days it’s easy. Some days it’s tough.  
But what matters is **showing up every single day**.

## 💡 Why I’m Doing This

- Build the habit of **thinking logically under pressure**
- Improve my **DSA fundamentals**
- Stay **consistent**, not just motivated
- Prepare for **placements, coding contests, and real-world problem-solving**
- Get **1% better every day**

## 🚀 What This Repo Contains

- Daily solutions from platforms like:
  - **LeetCode**
  - **Codeforces**
  - **GeeksforGeeks**

## 🔥 My Rules (No Excuses Zone)

- **Solve at least 1 problem daily**
- **Push the code on GitHub daily**
- Even if it's a busy day → **do something**
- If I fall behind → **catch up fast**
- Slow improvement > Zero improvement
